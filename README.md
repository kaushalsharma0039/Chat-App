         I developed a real-time chat application using Socket.IO, enabling seamless bidirectional communication between users. The app allows users to send and receive messages instantly through WebSocket technology, creating a smooth real-time messaging experience. It features support for multiple chat rooms, enabling users to join specific groups for focused conversations. The server, built with Socket.IO, efficiently manages connections, broadcasts messages, and handles events like joining rooms and sending notifications. The front end is designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface. This project showcases my expertise in real-time communication, event-driven programming, and full-stack development.
